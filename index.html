                        <p class="lead"> Greetings my name is Blair Betts and I am a current student of the UNC BootCamp
                            program. I
                            am a
                            graduate
                            from UNC Greensboro with a bachelors degree in communication studies. During my time at UNCG
                            I
                            also
                            played
                            baseball. Being a former collegiate athlete I am familar with the defintion of hard work and
                            adveristy.
                            I
                            ehanced my time management skills as well as drive to be a perfectionist. While I understand
                            perfection
                            may
                            not alwasys be achievable that is always the goal that I strive for. This is a trait that I
                            took
                            with me
                            as
                            I began my collegiate coaching career.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p class="lead"> Baseball however is just one demtion about me. I was rasied by a programmer and
                            a
                            music
                            teacher so I
                            have
                            some creativity about me as well. I pursued my musical talents through high school and still
                            revert
                            back
                            those skills ocasionaly. Having this mindset I tend to see things a little differently than
                            normal.
                            I'll
                            constentally break things down but then give them my own little twist to them..</p>
